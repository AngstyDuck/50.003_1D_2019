# For team mates

### Getting Around
- Documentations and project requirements are stored in ./Documentation
- I'll be leaving my logs in ./Documentation, feel free to leave yours inside as well


### Considerations
- Possibly host web page on heroku when displaying to client
- Possibly use PivotalTracker to keep track of code progress
