# For team mates
Note: Everyone is free to edit this README as well to share resources and document important changes for others to read.
Whenever a new use case is being worked on, create a new branch, and only merge it with the master branch when the code passes the tests you've written for. When addional code is added to our master branch, we assume the pre-existing code already works. For any help for using git, feel free to drop me (junde) a question :D
